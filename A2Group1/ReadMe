*Detects the Root tag and will not accept a second opening tag that matches the root tag
  and will not allow the root tag to be closed unless it is the last opened tag

*Detects any data after closing tags where no tag is considered "open" on the same line

*Detects intersecting tags, if a tag is attempted to be closed but it does not match,
  the tag is removed from the opened list and an error is raised
